### Overview

**Sustaining POWER** is an interactive analytics platform designed to forecast energy consumption and visualize global energy systems in support of the **UN Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable & Clean Energy**.

The project combines predictive modeling, geospatial visualization, and energy system analytics to help policymakers, researchers, and investors understand future energy demand and sustainability gaps.

### The Problem

Global energy systems face increasing challenges:

    - Rising per-capita energy demand
    - Unequal access to clean electricity
    - Slow renewable adoption in developing regions
    - Limited forward-looking decision tools

Without predictive insights, energy planning risks falling behind sustainability goals.
